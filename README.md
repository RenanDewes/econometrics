# econometrics
Just some tests and stuff to university and hobbies

Hello!

This repository is literally just some tests that I do/did to other projects that use ARMA and ARIMA models to analyse and predict data (soon I'll post them here, I think).

I did my own auto arima function and tests with ACF and PACF.

If you have any question, please let me know: renan_dewes@hotmail.com
